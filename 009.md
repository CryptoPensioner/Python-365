# Lesson 9: File Handling

File handling is an essential skill in programming, allowing us to read from and write to files. Python provides built-in functions and methods for working with files, making it easy to perform file-related operations.

Let's explore how to handle files in Python:

```python
# Creating and writing to a file
file = open("example.txt", "w")  # Open the file in write mode
file.write("Hello, world!\n")
file.write("This is a sample text.")
file.close()  # Close the file

# Reading from a file
file = open("example.txt", "r")  # Open the file in read mode
content = file.read()
file.close()  # Close the file

print("File content:")
print(content)

# Appending to a file
file = open("example.txt", "a")  # Open the file in append mode
file.write("\nThis line is appended.")
file.close()  # Close the file
```

# Explanation:

- We create a file named "example.txt" and open it in write mode (`"w"`).
- We use the `write()` method to write content to the file, including a newline character (`"\n"`) to separate lines.
- After writing, we close the file using the `close()` method.
- We then open the file in read mode (`"r"`), read its content using the `read()` method, and store it in the `content` variable.
- Finally, we print the content and demonstrate appending to the file by opening it in append mode (`"a"`) and using the `write()` method again.

Now it's time for a practical task:

# Task 9: 
Write a Python program that reads the content of a text file named "data.txt" and counts the number of lines in the file. Print the count at the end.

Once you've completed the task, you can proceed to the [next lesson](010.md).
