# Lesson 5: Loops (for and while)

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. They are essential for performing repetitive tasks and iterating over collections of data. In Python, we have two types of loops: `for` and `while`.

Let's explore how to use loops in Python:

```python
# Example 1: for loop
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

# Example 2: while loop
count = 0

while count < 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```

## Explanation:

- In example 1, we use a `for` loop to iterate over the elements in the `fruits` list. The variable `fruit` takes on each element's value in each iteration, and we print it.
- In example 2, we use a `while` loop to repeatedly execute the block of code as long as the condition `count < 5` is true. We print the current value of `count` and increment it by 1 in each iteration.

Now it's time for a practical task:

## Task 5: 
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and prints all the numbers from 1 to that integer using a `for` loop.


Once you've completed the task, you can proceed to the [next lesson](006.md).
