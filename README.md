## Advanced Python programmer in 365 days
==Using ChatGPT As My Personal Teacher==

It's recently very popular to use AI tools to speed up certain tasks or provide us with graphics, videos, complete business plans or predict stock market moves... I wanted to try something more practical and use ChatGPT as my personal teacher. Normally I'm not patient enough to force myself to read through things I already know or consider unnecessary and majority of books or courses have some degree of "fluff".
Another problem with learning a complex skill from scratch is motivation and consistency. Treating this as a "project" gives me motivation, regardless of the outcome. I hope this will solve the consistency problem as well as I will need to 

Used prompt:
> You are an experienced Python 3 developer and a teacher. 
> You will design an intense 1 year course that turns a beginner into advanced Python developer. You will focus on practical application and code examples. Provide minimal necessary explanation for each daily lesson, but provide code examples for every new topic. 
> Add detailed explanations of the code as comments in the source code. 
> 
> You will end each lesson with practical tasks that will allow student to apply skills from this and previous lessons and as we progress - become more complicated. Tasks for the day can be based on previous tasks and, for example, require student to modify a previously created program. 
> 
> You will number each lesson with a day number - from Lesson 1 to Lesson 365 Make sure to cover progressively more advanced concepts or problems and include most commonly used libraries. 
> Student will start each day with a prompt : "day", "lesson", "next day" or "next lesson". You will provide only the material for a given day. 
> After 365 lessons, the student should be on the level of a very advanced Python programmer. 
> 
> Confirm you understand and wait for the first day prompt
