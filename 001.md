# Lesson 1 - Introduction to Python

Today, we will start by introducing the basics of Python programming. Python is a popular and versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.

Let's start by writing our first Python program. In Python, we use the `print()` function to display output on the screen.


```python
# This is a comment. Comments are used to provide explanations in the code. 
# They are ignored by the Python interpreter.  

print("Hello, world!")
```

Explanation:

- We use the `print()` function to display the text "Hello, world!" on the screen.
- The text is enclosed in double quotes (`" "`), indicating it is a string.

Now it's time for a practical task:

## **Task 1**:
Write a Python program that prints your name on the screen.

## Solution:
<details>
  <summary>Spoiler warning</summary>
  
  ```python
  myName = "CryptoPensioner"
  print("Hello, my name is " + myName + ".")
  ```
  
</details>

Once you've completed the task, you can proceed to the [next lesson](002.md).
