# Lesson 18: Generators and Iterators

Generators and iterators are powerful concepts in Python that allow for efficient and memory-friendly iteration over a sequence of values. They enable lazy evaluation, generating values on-the-fly rather than generating all values at once.

Let's explore generators and iterators in Python:

```python
# Creating a generator function
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

# Using a generator function
for num in countdown(5):
    print(num)

# Creating an iterator using iter() and next()
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_iter = iter(my_list)

# Using the iterator
print(next(my_iter))  # 1
print(next(my_iter))  # 2
print(next(my_iter))  # 3
print(next(my_iter))  # 4
print(next(my_iter))  # 5

# Creating an iterator class
class MyIterator:
    def __init__(self, my_list):
        self.my_list = my_list
        self.index = 0

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def __next__(self):
        if self.index >= len(self.my_list):
            raise StopIteration
        value = self.my_list[self.index]
        self.index += 1
        return value

# Using the iterator class
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_iter = MyIterator(my_list)

for num in my_iter:
    print(num)
```

## Explanation:

- Generators are created using generator functions, defined with the `yield` keyword. The `yield` statement allows the function to yield a value and temporarily suspend its execution. The generator function can be iterated over using a `for` loop or by manually calling the `next()` function on the generator object.
- Iterators can be created using the `iter()` function, which takes an iterable object as an argument and returns an iterator. The `next()` function is used to retrieve the next element from the iterator. When there are no more elements, the `StopIteration` exception is raised.
- Iterators can also be created by defining a class that implements the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods. The `__iter__()` method returns the iterator object itself, and the `__next__()` method returns the next value from the iterator or raises `StopIteration` when there are no more values.

Now it's time for a practical task:

## Task 18: 
Write a generator function called `fibonacci()` that generates the Fibonacci sequence. The function should yield each Fibonacci number one at a time. Test the generator by iterating over it and printing the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.

Once you've completed the task, you can proceed to the [next lesson](019.md).
