# Lesson 10: Error Handling (Exception Handling)

Error handling, also known as exception handling, allows us to gracefully handle and manage errors that may occur during the execution of our programs. By handling errors, we can prevent our programs from crashing and provide meaningful feedback to the users.

Let's explore how to handle errors in Python using exception handling:

```python
# Basic try-except block
try:
    # Code that might raise an error
    x = 10 / 0  # Division by zero
except:
    # Code to handle the error
    print("An error occurred.")

# Specific exception handling
try:
    # Code that might raise an error
    num = int("abc")  # ValueError: invalid literal for int()
except ValueError:
    # Code to handle the specific error
    print("Invalid value provided.")

# Handling multiple exceptions
try:
    # Code that might raise an error
    x = 10 / 0  # Division by zero
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code to handle the ZeroDivisionError
    print("Cannot divide by zero.")
except Exception as e:
    # Code to handle other exceptions
    print("An error occurred:", str(e))
```

## Explanation:

- We use a `try-except` block to handle potential errors.
- The `try` block contains the code that might raise an error.
- If an error occurs, the corresponding `except` block is executed to handle the error.
- In the first example, we catch any exception with a generic `except` block and print a general error message.
- In the second example, we catch a specific `ValueError` and handle it with a custom message.
- In the third example, we handle different exceptions (`ZeroDivisionError` and `Exception`) separately.

Now it's time for a practical task:

## Task 10: 
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number. Use exception handling to handle the case where the user enters a non-numeric value. If a non-numeric value is entered, display an error message. If a numeric value is entered, calculate and print its square.

Once you've completed the task, you can proceed to the [next lesson](011.md).
