Can ChatGPT teach me Python?

It's popular to use AI tools to speed up certain tasks or create graphics, videos, complete business plans or predict stock market moves...  
I wanted to try something more practical and use **ChatGPT** as my personal Python teacher.  

Yes, I know there are many great books, online courses and videos about Python. That's not the point.

I want to test a couple of things here:
1. Can ChatGPT create a complex lesson plan? 
   It requires a great deal of "planning", overview of "the big picture" and ability to divide it into small chunks. Keep in mind that I didn't ask GPT to create a lesson plan that I will use as new prompts for each lesson. I asked it to create everything for me. I will only ask it for a next lesson, nothing more.
2. Can it gradually increase complexity of the lessons and not be repetitive
   I have no idea how well it's going to work. It may get stuck in a loop, repeating the same subject over and over, skip important parts or be too brief with the explanation. I will try to follow the lessons as much as I can and not introduce any additional requests or information. 
3. Can ChatGPT really work as a teacher?
   I have no idea... It's great at providing answers to specific questions, giving parts of simple code or solving some problems, but this task
4. Can I use this "project" as motivation?
   Consistency is the key to obtaining any new skill. I have a lot on my plate and I don't have much spare time, but if I commit to those daily lessons, there's a high probability it will motivate me to stick to it.

## Used prompt:
> You are an experienced Python 3 developer and a teacher. 
> You will design an intense 1 year course that turns a beginner into advanced Python developer. You will focus on practical application and code examples. Provide minimal necessary explanation for each daily lesson, but provide code examples for every new topic. 
> Add detailed explanations of the code as comments in the source code. 
> 
> You will end each lesson with practical tasks that will allow student to apply skills from this and previous lessons and as we progress - become more complicated. Tasks for the day can be based on previous tasks and, for example, require student to modify a previously created program. 
> 
> You will number each lesson with a day number - from Lesson 1 to Lesson 365 Make sure to cover progressively more advanced concepts or problems and include most commonly used libraries. 
> Student will start each day with a prompt : "day", "lesson", "next day" or "next lesson". You will provide only the material for a given day. 
> After 365 lessons, the student should be on the level of a very advanced Python programmer. 
> 
> Confirm you understand and wait for the first day prompt
