# Lesson 2 - Variables and Data Types

In Python, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They act as containers for holding values. Python supports different data types, such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

Let's start by learning how to declare variables and work with different data types:

```python
# Declaring variables
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 1.65
is_student = True

# Printing variable values
print("Name:", name)
print("Age:", age)
print("Height:", height)
print("Is Student?", is_student)
```
Explanation:

- We declare variables `name`, `age`, `height`, and `is_student` to store different types of data.
- The variable `name` is assigned a string value "Alice", `age` is assigned an integer value 25, `height` is assigned a float value 1.65, and `is_student` is assigned a boolean value True.
- We use the `print()` function to display the values of the variables on the screen.

Now it's time for a practical task:

Task 2: Write a Python program that declares variables for your name, age, and favorite color. Print out the values of these variables on separate lines.

Once you've completed the task, you can proceed to the next lesson.
