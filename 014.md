# Lesson 14: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Polymorphism

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables code flexibility and reusability by providing a consistent interface for interacting with different objects, regardless of their specific implementations.

Let's explore polymorphism in Python:

```python
# Polymorphism
class Shape:
    def calculate_area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def calculate_area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def calculate_area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

# Creating objects
rectangle = Rectangle(5, 3)
circle = Circle(7)

# Calculating areas
print("Rectangle area:", rectangle.calculate_area())
print("Circle area:", circle.calculate_area())
```

## Explanation:

- We define a base class `Shape` with a method `calculate_area()`.
- We define two derived classes, `Rectangle` and `Circle`, that inherit from the `Shape` class and override the `calculate_area()` method with their specific implementations.
- We create objects of both classes, `rectangle` and `circle`.
- We call the `calculate_area()` method on both objects, which invokes the appropriate method based on the object's class.

Polymorphism allows us to treat the objects uniformly by using a common interface (`calculate_area()` method in this example), even though they have different implementations.

Now it's time for a practical task:

## Task 14: 
Create a class called `Animal` with a method `make_sound()` that prints a generic sound. Create two derived classes, `Cat` and `Dog`, that inherit from `Animal`. Override the `make_sound()` method in each derived class to print the specific sound of a cat and a dog, respectively. Create objects of both derived classes and call the `make_sound()` method on each object.

Once you've completed the task, you can proceed to the [next lesson](015.md).
