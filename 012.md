# Lesson 12: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows us to create new classes based on existing classes. The new class, known as the derived class or subclass, inherits the attributes and methods of the existing class, known as the base class or superclass. This promotes code reuse and enables the creation of specialized classes that extend or modify the behavior of the base class.

Let's explore how to use inheritance in Python:

```python
# Base class
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        print("The animal speaks.")

# Derived class
class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        super().__init__(name)
        self.breed = breed

    def speak(self):
        print("Woof! Woof!")

# Creating objects
animal = Animal("Generic Animal")
dog = Dog("Buddy", "Labrador")

# Accessing attributes
print("Animal:", animal.name)
print("Dog:", dog.name, dog.breed)

# Calling methods
animal.speak()
dog.speak()
```

## Explanation:

- We have a base class `Animal` that represents a generic animal with a `name` attribute and a `speak()` method.
- We define a derived class `Dog` that inherits from the `Animal` class. The `Dog` class adds a `breed` attribute and overrides the `speak()` method with a specialized implementation.
- We create objects of both classes, `animal` and `dog`.
- We access the attributes (`name` and `breed`) using dot notation.
- We call the methods (`speak()`) on the objects, which will invoke the appropriate method based on the object's class.

Now it's time for a practical task:

## Task 12: 
Create a class called `Square` that represents a square object. The `Square` class should inherit from a `Rectangle` class (from the previous lesson) and add a method called `is_square()` that checks if the rectangle is actually a square by comparing its width and height. Create a square object and test the `calculate_area()`, `calculate_perimeter()`, and `is_square()` methods.

Once you've completed the task, you can proceed to the [next lesson](013.md).
