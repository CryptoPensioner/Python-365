# That should be simple enough....

# Here's a variable with my name
myName = "CryptoPensioner"

# Here's a simple print() with text and myName variable
print("Hello, my name is " + myName + ".")

# Formatter print
print("This is a formatted print: {0}.".format(myName))

# This is an f-string print
print(f"This is an f-string print: {myName}.")
